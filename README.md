This project analyzed and visualized hotel data for 2018-2020 in Power BI.
Results:
**Revenue Trends:**
    Revenue increased in 2019 compared to 2018, but decreased in 2020 for both hotels.

**Seasonal Revenue:**
    The highest revenue growth occurred in July, August, and September for 2018 and 2019. However, in 2020, revenue significantly dropped starting from September.

**Discount Patterns:**
    July, August, and September saw the highest levels of discounts. During the winter season, discounts were lower, which did not boost revenue. Stakeholders should consider revising the marketing discount policy.

**Revenue Comparison:**
    The total revenue for the two hotels was almost the same, except in 2018 when the Resort Hotel contributed 63.64% of the revenue.

**Revenue Sources:**
    The majority of revenue came from Online Travel Agencies (averaging 59% over three years), followed by Direct bookings (17.83%) and Offline bookings (15.92%). Online bookings have been increasing year by year, 
    indicating a key area for marketing focus.

**Family Demographics:**
    The highest number of children and babies were present in July, August, and September, likely due to summer school holidays. 
    This suggests the need for entertainment options for children during these months and a focus on adults in other months.

**Repeat Guests:**
    The number of repeat guests has been increasing each year but remains low. Feedback analysis is necessary to understand the reasons and improve retention.

**Cancellations:**
    The number of cancellations has also been increasing. Analyzing the reasons for cancellations and considering prepayment options, especially for the high season, could mitigate this issue.
